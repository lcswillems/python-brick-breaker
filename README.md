Creating and editing levels is also an easy task:

1. Execute `python editor.py`
2. Enter the level number:
	- If the level exists, it will be opened.
	- If the level doesn't exist, it will be created.
3. Edit the level:
	1. Left click on a brick at the bottom of the screen to select its color.
	2. Left click on a brick at the middle/top of the screen to make it take the selected color.
	3. Right click on a brick at the middle/top of the screen to delete it.
